**Project Name:** ForestNav Challenge

**Description:**
In this project for the ForestNav Challenge, we aim to address the data processing and biomass calculation aspects using point-cloud data. This will be achieved through the utilization of software such as CloudCompare, along with Python and R scripts. The goal is to visualize forest biomass quantities via barplot and boxplot graphs.
